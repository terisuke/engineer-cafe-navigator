# GCP specific (service account keys are often .json, but ignoring all .json is dangerous)
# It's safer to ignore the .env file which contains the path, or explicitly ignore the known key file name if it's fixed.
# Assuming the service account key path is stored in .env, ignoring .env is sufficient.
# If you have a specific service account key file name like 'service-account.json' at the root, uncomment the line below:
# service-account.json
