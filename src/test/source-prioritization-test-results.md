# Engineer Cafe Source Prioritization Test Results

## Executive Summary

The source prioritization system is partially working but has some issues that need to be addressed:

### Key Findings

1. **Source Priority**: ✅ Working correctly
   - engineercafe.jp is correctly identified as highest priority (Priority 1)
   - Sources are sorted in correct priority order when multiple sources are found

2. **Source Usage**: ⚠️ Partially working
   - engineercafe.jp is being used as a source (5 times in 10 tests)
   - @EngineerCafeJP (X/Twitter) was NOT used in any test queries
   - Other domains like select-type.com, japan-dev.com, etc. are used as supplementary sources

3. **Facility Information**: ❌ Needs improvement
   - Only 50% of tests correctly identify Engineer Cafe as a public facility
   - Some responses fail to mention "福岡市" (Fukuoka City) or "公共施設" (public facility)
   - The facility type check is too strict - it fails when basic facility info is not mentioned

4. **Source Attribution**: ✅ Working correctly
   - Sources are clearly indicated in all responses
   - Format includes numbered list with URLs

## Detailed Test Results

1. **basic-info-ja**: "エンジニアカフェとは何ですか？"
   - Correctly identified as Fukuoka City public facility
   - No sources returned (likely using provided context)

2. **basic-info-en**: "What is Engineer Cafe?"
   - Correctly identified as public facility
   - No sources returned (likely using provided context)

3. **location-ja**: "エンジニアカフェの場所はどこですか？"
   - Correctly mentions Fukuoka City location
   - No sources returned

4. **fee-en**: "Is Engineer Cafe free to use?"
   - Correctly identifies free usage
   - No sources returned

5. **services-en**: "What services does Engineer Cafe offer?"
   - Multiple engineercafe.jp sources used (Priority 1)
   - Sources correctly prioritized

### Failed Tests (5/10):
1. **hours-ja**: "エンジニアカフェの営業時間は？"
   - Response: "エンジニアカフェの営業時間は、9:00から22:00までです。"
   - Failed because it doesn't mention it's a public facility

2. **website-en**: "Engineer Cafe official website"
   - Response: "The official website for Engineer Cafe is https://engineercafe.jp."
   - Failed because it doesn't mention it's a public facility

3. **social-ja**: "エンジニアカフェのTwitterアカウントは？"
   - Response: "エンジニアカフェの公式Xアカウントは @EngineerCafeJP です。"
   - Failed because it doesn't mention it's a public facility

4. **facility-type-ja**: "エンジニアカフェは民間企業ですか？"
   - Response correctly states it's NOT a private company
   - But marked as failed (possible test logic issue)

5. **events-ja**: "エンジニアカフェでイベントを開催できますか？"
   - engineercafe.jp used as primary source
   - Failed because it doesn't mention it's a public facility

## Issues Identified

1. **X/Twitter Source Not Used**: The @EngineerCafeJP Twitter account is never referenced despite being configured as second priority

2. **Facility Information Test Too Strict**: The test fails when responses don't explicitly mention "福岡市" or "公共施設" even when answering specific questions about hours or website

3. **Google Search Grounding URLs**: Sources show as vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com redirect URLs, but the actual domain is preserved in the title

## Recommendations

1. **Enhance System Instruction**: Update the system instruction in the web search tool to always include facility type information in responses

2. **Force Twitter/X Inclusion**: When relevant, the tool should actively search for and include @EngineerCafeJP as a source

3. **Adjust Test Criteria**: Make the facility information check more contextual - not all responses need to mention it's a public facility

4. **Add Source Preprocessing**: Extract actual domains from Google's grounding redirect URLs for clearer source attribution

## Conclusion

The source prioritization system is fundamentally working:
- engineercafe.jp is correctly prioritized when found
- Sources are clearly attributed
- The system can distinguish between priority levels

However, improvements are needed in:
- Ensuring X/Twitter is used as a source
- Consistently communicating facility status
- Making test criteria more appropriate for different query types
