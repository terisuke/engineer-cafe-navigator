1 Welcome everyone to Engineer Cafe, a public space where engineers can learn, connect and grow. This deck explains our facilities and how to use them.
2 Engineer Cafe was born through cooperation between Fukuoka City and its citizens. Our community manager and volunteer Hacker Supporters assist you every day.
3 You can choose from three areas. Remember the Focus Space is a strict quiet zone; tell reception if you need to move seats.
4 Seats are allotted in two-hour blocks but you may extend as often as you like when space is available. Request extensions early via staff or Discord.
5 Because the hall is a protected cultural asset, food is prohibited. Sealed drinks are the only exception—and straws are still not allowed.
6 Start by connecting to our guest Wi-Fi, then register via the QR code. Please enter the membership ID together with staff to avoid mistakes.
7 Your card is unique and not reissuable, but we can look you up if it's lost. You can also link the ID to an NFC card or phone for smooth entry.
8 At reception just specify the space. Your neck holder shows Wi-Fi and a Discord invite. Please return it when you leave.
9 We strive to minimise formal rules. With mutual respect, we can keep the café flexible and welcoming for all.
10 That concludes the guide. Feel free to reach out to our team any time.
