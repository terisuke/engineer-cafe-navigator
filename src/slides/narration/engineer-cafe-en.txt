1 Welcome everyone to Engineer Cafe, a public space where engineers can learn, connect and grow. This deck explains our facilities and how to use them.
2 You can choose from three areas. Remember the Focus Space is a strict quiet zone; tell reception if you need to move seats.
3 The basement offers four distinct zones—meeting, focus, under, and makers—each with its own rules and equipment.
4 Seats are allotted in two-hour blocks but you may extend as often as you like when space is available. Request extensions early via staff or Discord.
5 Because the hall is a protected cultural asset, food is prohibited. Sealed drinks are the only exception—and straws are still not allowed.
6 Connect to our guest Wi-Fi, register via the QR code, and after submitting tell staff the membership number shown on your screen.
7 Link your membership number to an NFC card like Suica for tap-in entry; if you forget your card, staff can look up your number on our system.
8 At reception just specify the space. Your neck holder shows Wi-Fi and a Discord invite. If you leave for more than 15 minutes, do NOT leave your belongings behind.
9 That concludes the guide. Feel free to reach out to our team any time.
