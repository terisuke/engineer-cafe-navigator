## Our Philosophy

> Fewer rules, more collaboration

- We avoid strict regulations  
- Lack of cooperation forces rules on everyone  
- Let's keep Engineer Cafe free, comfortable and fun

<!-- _narration: We strive to minimise formal rules. With mutual respect, we can keep the café flexible and welcoming for all. -->
