- Precision response system for specific information requests
- Generic request handling for any entity type

#### Production Features
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Performance metrics tracking
- Alert webhook system
- CRON-based knowledge updates (6-hour intervals)

#### STT Correction System
- Pattern-based corrections for Japanese terms
- "エンジニアカフェ" misrecognition fixes
- Context-aware processing

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Current)

#### Integrated Test Suite
- Comprehensive test scenarios covering:
  - Basic information queries
  - Facility navigation
  - Memory and context handling
  - Multi-language support
  - Edge cases and error scenarios
  - Performance testing

#### Documentation Updates
- Cleaned up outdated references
- Updated STATUS.md to reflect actual implementation
- Archived completed migration scripts
- Consolidated implementation reports

## Major Technical Decisions

### 1. Embedding Model Choice
**Decision**: Migrate from Google to OpenAI embeddings
**Rationale**: 
- Native 1536D support without padding
- Better Japanese text performance
- Improved search accuracy (63.5% improvement)

### 2. Memory Architecture Simplification
**Decision**: Replace complex multi-layer system with SimplifiedMemorySystem
**Rationale**:
- Reduced complexity and maintenance burden
- Better performance with direct database operations
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Audio System Architecture
**Decision**: Unify all audio through AudioPlaybackService
**Rationale**:
- Consistent behavior across components
- Better mobile/tablet compatibility
- Simplified error handling

### 4. Response Precision Enhancement
**Decision**: Implement specific request detection and filtering
**Rationale**:
- Users expect concise answers for factual queries
- Reduces response verbosity from 3000+ to 50-100 characters
- Improves user experience

## Performance Improvements

### Search Accuracy
- **Before**: 38.9% accuracy with Google embeddings + padding
- **After**: 63.5% accuracy with OpenAI embeddings
- **Improvement**: 63.5% increase in search relevance

### Response Times
- **RAG Search**: ~200-500ms average
- **Memory Retrieval**: ~50-100ms for recent context
- **Audio Playback**: 10-50ms for cached lip-sync data

### Mobile Performance
- **Lip-sync Analysis**: Reduced from 4-8s to 1-3s
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80%+ for repeated audio
- **iOS Compatibility**: Graceful degradation to audio-only when needed

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Embedding Dimensions Matter
Zero-padding is not a viable solution for dimension mismatches. Native support is crucial for accuracy.

### 2. Simplicity Over Complexity
The simplified memory system outperforms the complex multi-layer architecture in both performance and maintainability.

### 3. Mobile-First Audio Design
Browser autoplay policies require careful handling. Web Audio API with proper fallbacks is essential.

### 4. Context Inheritance is Key
Natural conversations require understanding implicit context from previous interactions.

### 5. Production Monitoring is Essential
Real-time metrics and alerting enable quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Future Considerations

### Short-term
- Improve iOS/iPad audio compatibility
- Add unit test framework
- Enhance calendar integration
- Optimize response generation speed

### Long-term
- Web Speech API integration for cost reduction
- Facial expression detection via camera
- Additional language support
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## Migration Status

### Completed Migrations
- ✅ Google → OpenAI embeddings (2025-07-02)
- ✅ Complex → Simplified memory system
- ✅ HTML Audio → Web Audio API
- ✅ Manual updates → CRON automation

### Archived Scripts
All migration scripts have been moved to `scripts/archive/` after successful execution:
- SQL migration scripts
- Embedding regeneration scripts
- Fix implementation scripts
- Database schema updates
