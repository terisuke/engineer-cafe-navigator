# RAG System Fix Report
Date: 2025-07-02

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system was not working correctly because of **embedding model inconsistency**:

- **Knowledge Base Entries**: Using Google text-embedding-004 (768 dims → padded to 1536)
- **Search Queries**: Using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims)
- **Result**: Cosine similarity between different embedding spaces is meaningless

This explains why queries like "sainoカフェの休館日は？" were returning incorrect or no results.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Embedding Model
- Migrated all 93 knowledge base entries to **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small**
- Consistent 1536-dimension embeddings for both content and queries
- Better performance for Japanese text
- Lower cost: $0.02 vs $0.13 per 1M tokens

### 2. Database Updates
- Fixed Saino cafe closing day: "毎月最終月曜日" (last Monday of each month)
- Added 8 Aka-Renga Cultural Center entries
- All entries now have consistent OpenAI embeddings

### 3. Verification Results
✅ RAG search now returns correct results:
- "sainoカフェの休館日" → Correctly returns "毎月最終月曜日"
- "赤煉瓦文化会館の営業時間" → Returns "9:00〜19:00"
- Cross-language search working properly

### 4. Integration Status
✅ **Google Calendar**: Working, fetches events successfully
✅ **Web Search**: Working, handles sports/weather/news queries
✅ **Memory System**: 3-minute conversation context maintained
✅ **STT Correction**: Japanese term corrections active

## 📝 Essential Scripts

### Database Maintenance
1. `fix-saino-aka-renga-sql.sql` - SQL commands for content fixes
2. `apply-saino-aka-renga-fixes.ts` - Apply database updates via Supabase
3. `migrate-to-openai-embeddings.ts` - Migrate all embeddings to OpenAI model

### Integration Testing
4. `test-calendar-integration.ts` - Verify Google Calendar integration
5. `test-web-search-integration.ts` - Verify web search functionality
6. `comprehensive-navigation-test.ts` - Full system navigation test (JA/EN)
7. `final-verification-test.ts` - Quick essential feature verification

### Documentation
8. `fix-embedding-consistency.ts` - Analyzes embedding model issues (educational)

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### Why It Failed
- Different embedding models produce vectors in different mathematical spaces
- Cosine similarity between Google and OpenAI embeddings is meaningless
- This is a common pitfall when mixing embedding providers

### Why It Works Now
- All embeddings use the same model (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
- Consistent 1536-dimensional vector space
- Proper cosine similarity calculations

### Best Practices
1. **Always use the same embedding model** for both indexing and querying
2. Document embedding model choices in CLAUDE.md
3. Include embedding model metadata with each entry
4. Test RAG search after any embedding changes

## 🚀 System Status

The navigation AI can now accurately answer questions about:
- All three facilities (Engineer Cafe, Saino, Aka-Renga)
- Operating hours and closing days with correct information
- Upcoming events from Google Calendar
- General queries via web search

**The system is ready for production use with accurate RAG search functionality.**
